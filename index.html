                        <p>A hackathon is a short intensive event during which people come together, form teams and attempt to complete a project that is of interest to them. Teams are usually collocated, and often composed of people with diverse backgrounds, experience, and expertise <sup>[1]</sup>. To get a more concrete idea we provided links to hackathons we co-organized <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#co-organized-hackathons">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>This website is organized around 12 key designs decisions organizers have to take when planning a hackathon. For each decision, we provide information about who should be involved in the decision, when you should consider making it, how to make the choice and implement its result, and discuss potential tradeoffs among the various options.</p>
                        <p>For <i>first-time organizers</i> we provide <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#examples">example timelines</a> for two types of hackathons. These walk you through the different decision points and show you examples for how and why you could decide for one or the other option.</p>
                        <p><i>Experienced organizers</i> can directly access an overview of <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#decisions">design decisions</a> and create their own timeline for a hackathon that fits their needs.</p>

Yet there is a paucity of research on corporate hackathons, which are nearly ubiquitous and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges. To provide a comprehensive understanding of team processes and broad array of outcomes of corporate hackathons, we conducted a mixed-methods, multiple case study of five teams that participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Two teams were “pre-existing” teams (PETs) and three were newly-formed “flash” teams (FTs). Our analysis revealed that PETs coordinated almost as if it was just another day at the office while creating innovations within the boundary of their regular work, whereas FTs adopted role-based coordination adapted to the hackathon context while creating innovations beyond the boundary of their regular work. Project sustainability depended on how much effort the team put into finding a home for their projects and whether their project was a good fit with existing products in the organization’s product portfolio. Moreover, hackathon participation had perceived positive effects on participants’ skills, careers, and social networks.</p>

                                <p id="pub11abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as <i>mentors</i> which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a <i>mentor</i> role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.</p>

During these events participants typically form teams, exercise fast prototype development, challenge themselves to innovate, practice new skills, collaborate with diverse team members, and compete against other teams. Hackathon organizers have a certain vision in mind about which outcome they would like to achieve and design the event based on this vision. Participants on the other hand do not necessarily share the same vision and come with their own goals and aspirations. While work in related fields suggests that it is important for goals of organizers and participants to align in order to achieve them this might be different in hackathons due to their unique setup. Drawing from literature we identified potential goals of organizers and participants and conducted a case study of three hackathons focusing on the alignment of goals between organizers and participants. Our findings indicate that the goals of organizers and participants did not align in all cases, that goal awareness on the part of the organizers appears may have a stronger impact on goal achievement and that hackathons appear to have inherent characteristics that can materialize even when not planned for.</p>

                                <p id="pub9abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Nowadays, hackathons have become a popular way of bringing people together to engage in brief, intensive collaborative work. Despite being a brief activity, being collocated with team members and focused on a task 'radical collocation' could improve collaboration of scientific software teams. Using a mixed-methods study of participants who attended two hackathons at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), we examined how hackathons can facilitate collaboration in scientific software teams which typically involve members from two different disciplines: science and software engineering. We found that hackathons created a focused interruption-free working environment in which team members were able to assess each other's skills, focus together on a single project and leverage opportunities to exchange knowledge with other collocated participants, thereby allowing technical work to advance more efficiently. This study suggests hacking" as a new and productive form of collaborative work in scientific software production.</p>

Hackathons have become increasingly popular as a means to surface and prototype innovative and creative ideas for products, but their impact often goes beyond product innovation. Based on our empirical studies of 10 hackathons held by scientific communities, a corporation, and universities as well as the review of published literature, we discuss that hackathons can be organized around goals such as enriching social networks, facilitating collaborative learning, and workforce development. We also discuss design choices that can scaffold the organization of hackathons and their trade-offs. Design choices include identifying a suitable mixture of attendee skills, the selection process for projects and teams, and whether to hold a competitive or collaborative event. Hackathons can achieve multiple goals if designed carefully.</p>

Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.</p>

When done badly, however, it can lead to dysfunctional interpersonal relationships and may turn off mentees from careers in software engineering. In this qualitative interview-based study we examine how socio-technical dimensions of software impact the formation of social ties important for satisfying two goals of mentorship, building technical skill and interpersonal development. We find that mentees working on user facing, interdependent software form a balance of ties that facilitate both goals, while mentees working on non-user facing software mostly form ties important for building technical skill. Work practices that create opportunities for unstructured contact between mentees and community members, such as code review in a mentee cohort, can help to overcome this imbalance. Our findings have important implications for task definition in software engineering e-mentoring program schemes.</p>

Hackathons, it seems, are everywhere. We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.</p>

                                <p id="pub3abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Sharing scientific data, software, and instruments is becoming increasingly common as science moves toward large-scale, distributed collaborations. Sharing these resources requires extra work to make them generally useful. Although we know much about the extra work associated with sharing data, we know little about the work associated with sharing contributions to software, even though software is of vital importance to nearly every scientific result. This paper presents a qualitative, interview-based study of the extra work that developers and end users of scientific software undertake. Our findings indicate that they conduct a rich set of extra work around community management, code maintenance, education and training, developer-user interaction, and foreseeing user needs. We identify several conditions under which they are likely to do this work, as well as design principles that can facilitate it. Our results have important implications for future empirical studies as well as funding policy.</p>

But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceivedby the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.</p>

We conducted a case study of a bioinformatics software library called Biopython to investigate the promise of Google Summer of Code (GSoC), a program that pays students to work on open-source projects for the summer, for addressing these challenges. We find three positive outcomes of GSoC in the Biopython community: the addition of new features to the Biopython codebase, training, and personal development. We also find, however, that mentors face several challenges related to GSoC project selection and ranking. We believe that because GSoC provides an occasion to extend the software with capabilities that can be used to produce new knowledge, and to train successive generations of potential contributors to the software, it can play a vital role in the sustainability of open-source scientific software.</p>

Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.</p>

                                <p id="workshop4abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Based on our empirical studies of 14 hackathons held by a corporation (Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon), universities, and scientific communities including three hack days at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), we will present how hackathons can be designed to achieve specific goals in a semi-academic environment like STScI. Our recommendations are derived from the analysis of data collected through ethnographic observations, interviews, and questionnaires. Hackathons are not only a good way to foster innovation but also to provide learning and knowledge exchange opportunities, to create new and enhance existing social connections, to exercise new technical and leadership opportunities, and to get the needed work done or to make a quick progress on technical work. However, designing a hackathon involves careful upfront planning, project selection, team formation, goal setting, and follow-up activities. Before the hackathon, the organizers should ask potential participants to propose project ideas (e.g., highest priority needed work in the case of STScI), and elicit their skills, expertise, and project preference. The organizers should form teams by matching participants' skills to required skills for the projects. The resulting teams consist of a mix of members with varying levels of expertise. It is advisable for teams to perform preparatory work which includes appointing a team lead and having pre-event meetings where they discuss their plan for the event, break the projects into small individual tasks, assign tasks to team members, and familiarize themselves with the environment, project, and task. The organizers should advise teams to set realistic goals for the event and keep track of their progress toward these goals. At the end of the event, the organizers should advise teams to present their accomplishment and future plans, and encourage them to plan for future collaboration and designate a person to keep track of the progress. Examples include using the common free time to work side-by-side and self-organizing mini-hackathons (e.g., lunch hacks). With careful consideration of activities mentioned above, hackathons may provide a fruitful avenue of collaboration between astronomers and software experts.</p>

These web portals allow scientist to focus on research with little to no need to utilize programmatic skills. Hackathons are time-bounded events in which collaborators intensely focus on a given subject or problem in an effort to generate solutions. Hackathon events provide opportunities for participants with diverse backgrounds, mixed specialties, and broad skill sets to interact in a manner that promotes disruptive solutions. Hackathons come in a variety of different forms and serve many different purposes. These purposes include developing resources, infrastructure, practices, and culture for a community. The Science Gateways Community Institute team proposed a hackathon to introduce students attending the PEARC 2018 conference, to the concepts of Science Gateways. The aim of the hackathon was to stimulate interest in Science Gateways while developing projects that were of value to researchers from different disciplines. They believed that PEARC would be an ideal venue for this type of event, due to the community of researchers, students, and practitioners from various disciplines that were interested and skilled in the high-performance computing field attending the conference. The Science Gateways Community Institute utilized a hackathon formatted event to provide students with an opportunity to collaborate and generate targeted skills while creating needed features for production web portals. The student participants included a group of 17 graduate and undergraduate students with predominately underrepresented minorities. The hackathon followed the PEARC 2018 conference held in Pittsburgh, PA. The science gateways targeted during the event were MyGeoHub (Purdue University), Cosmic2 (San Diego Supercomputing Center), and SimCCS (Indiana University) with associated mentors serving as subject matter experts. This poster presents organizational methods and technologies used to coordinate the international planning team, lessons learned during the event, and deliverables presented by the student teams.</p>

Such time-bounded hackathon-style events have become increasingly popular across different domains in recent years. Collegiate hackathons, just one of the many variants of hackathons, that are supported by the largest hackathon league (https://mlh.io/) alone attract over 65,000 participants among more than 200 events each year. Variously known as data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints, edit-a-thons, mapathons, and so on, such events vary depending on different audiences and with divergent aims: for example, whether teams know each other beforehand, whether the event is structured as a competition with prizes, whether the event is open or requires membership or invitations, and whether the desired outcome is primarily a product innovation, learning a new skill, forming a community around a cause, solving a technical problem that requires intensive focus by a group, or just having fun. Taken together, hackathons offer new opportunities and challenges for collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for collaborative work and engaging with new audiences. With the goal of discussing opportunities and challenges surrounding hackathons of different kinds, this one-day workshop brought together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events as socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.</p>

                                <p id="workshop1abstract" class="listtoggle text-muted"><b>Abstract:</b> Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While hackathons", that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: "sprints" bring together existing communities to advance planned work, "code fests" bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, "hack-days" and "hack-weeks" teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, "edit-a-thons" support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brought together: researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events. The workshop aimed to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.</p>

                                            <p>The decision whether to have a competitive or collaborative hackathon should be made several months before an event. Competitive events, in particular, take considerable time to organize. Organizers must find credible judges, decide on suitable award criteria, determine prizes and prize categories, and ensure that prizes can be handed out at the end of an event. If the prizes have considerable monetary value or will involve a time commitment from experts whose time is very limited (e.g., the opportunity to pitch the team’s winning idea to potential investors), there may be considerable work for the organizers to secure sponsorship.</p>

An example for cooperative events is a series of cooperative hackathons <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read1">1</a>]</sup> that was organized to accelerate the development of integrated web services in the field of bioinformatics. Teams there worked on projects involving data standardization and interoperability of tools and services among others. Other cooperative hackathons aim to perfect an artifact. For example, the Debian Linux project launched the Debcamp event <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read2">2</a>]</sup>, a hacking session before the Debian Conference, where software developers whose work depends on the Debian Linux software distribution worked together to promote the redistribution, general availability, and mutual compatibility of software. Another example is a corporate hackathon series organized by STScI’s Hubble Space Telescope team that aimed to accelerate the migration of data analysis tools implemented in an old obsolescing language to a contemporary one <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read3">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline"><b>Competitive events</b> focus on teams winning prizes. Winners can be selected by a <b>jury</b> or based on a <b>popular vote</b>. Some hackathons also award special prizes to projects that meet specific challenges posed by sponsors or other stakeholders. If winners are selected by jury, it is necessary to invite judges and to specify suitable judging criteria. For judges, the organizers may consider recruiting (domain) experts from a university, community leaders, or representatives from tech companies <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read4">4</a>]</sup>. Some commonly used judging criteria include appeal to market, creativity, originality, completeness and level of difficulty. For a competition to be fair, it is important that judging criteria are well known in advance and that organizers make sure that participants do not simply turn up with solutions that have been built prior to the event. There are different approaches to award prizes based on a popular vote. Voting can e.g. be limited to on-site participants only or it can be replaced or augmented by online voting. The latter requires an online voting system as well as final presentation sessions to be live-streamed or presentation materials to be distributed online.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">In order to select the winning teams, the organizers should create a dedicated session at the conclusion of a hackathon to allow each participating team to pitch and demonstrate their idea to the entire audience of an event. This session could take the form either of an <b>on-stage presentation</b> or a <b>(science) fair</b>. In the former approach, each team is typically given a set time to present their prototypes in front of the entire event audience. For this it is important to inform participants in advance how their presentation will be evaluated, the presentation format, and the time limit. The commonly used presentation format starts with a brief introduction of team members and problems that they tried to solve, which is followed by a live demo <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read5">5</a>]</sup>. It is also possible that teams record a short introductory video and focus on their demo during the presentation. In a (science) fair style presentation session <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read5">5</a>]</sup>, each team is commonly allocated a booth in a large-enough space to set up their presentations and judges and visitors visit each booth to interact with the teams. This approach facilitates a greater face-to-face interaction between participants, judges, and other attendees. At the Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon we observed <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read6">6</a>,<a href="#decisionsModal3read7">7</a>]</sup>, teams could both attend a science fair and upload a video to an online platform where other participants and observers could vote on their favorite projects. This online voting enables individuals who are not able to attend the fair in person to participate in winner selection. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Prizes can vary greatly, with tech gadgets, cash prizes and opportunities for continued development of winning ideas probably being the most common. The opportunities for further development can take the form of providing additional resources, computing power, freeing up participants’ time to work on their project post-hackathon, or simply the opportunity to pitch their idea to top executives or investors. Awarding cash prizes is not always feasible or recommended approach <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read8">8</a>]</sup>. Major League Hacking (MLH) for example provides a few non-cash prize ideas <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal3read9">9</a>]</sup> such as laptops, headphones, conference tickets, etc. as alternatives.

                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Competition vs cooperation:</b> Competition is suitable for hackathons aiming to create innovations because, under competitive pressure, teams are likely to generate unique solutions to differentiate themselves from other competing teams and put more effort in their projects. However, competition discourages communication among teams, and hence is not suitable for hackathons aiming to enrich networking among participants beyond their own teams, or to engage participants in a common goal. On the other hand, cooperation works well whenever it furthers the organizers’ and participants’ goals, such as promoting a civic cause, providing different pieces of an integrated solution, or learning about programming tools or a particular domain. To reduce the severity of this trade off, it might be advisable to de-emphasize the prizes in a competitive event so that participants do not over-emphasize competition, e.g., by having prizes that are largely symbolic rather than great cash value. Heavily emphasizing prizes might put off many potential participants especially if they feel that the odds of winning a significant prize are low, that their idea might not work well with the proposed judging criteria or that judging might not be fair.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Jury vs popular vote:</b> Experts are more appropriate as judges if the desired criteria are technically complex. They will be much more able to determine if a prototype is actually feasible, for example, and if it actually addresses the problem claimed. On the other hand, if the desired result is something that addresses a widely-experienced need, or to produce something that seems cool or stylish, a popular vote may be more suitable.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>High value vs low value prizes:</b> High value prizes create a more serious atmosphere and level of competitiveness, and organizers will have to be very careful about finding skilled judges and applying the pre-specified criteria in a way that can be perceived as fair by hackathon participants. The rules will have to be very clear, e.g., about whether teams can form and start work prior to the hackathon and whether they can bring code they have written with them to the hackathon. If the highest possible level of professionalism, skill, and innovation is the goal, high value prizes are a good choice. Low value prizes are better when organizers and participants have a variety of goals such as learning, expanding social ties, or attracting new people to a community. As the value of prizes approaches zero (e.g., special hats or shirts), competitive hackathons can look much more like collaborative hackathons. With inherently competitive populations, however, even symbolic prizes can make some teams behave very competitively.</li>

After defining goals and themes for the hackathon, organizers should ask themselves: Who would be the target audience for an event? When should they start recruitment? How to draw interest and attention to an event? We will provide suggestions for those in the following.</p>

                                            <p>Participants need to be recruited and have to register before the hackathon. The exact time that recruitment needs to occur varies based on the scope of the event, the degree to which the target audience is known, and the amount of planning needed for potential participants to take part in a hackathon (i.e. location and time). As such the organizers should discuss who they would want to participate at the very beginning of the event organization before they develop or deploy any recruitment strategy. Organizers sometimes recruit participants up to a year before an event as e.g. in the case of events for specialized communities such as Astro Hack Week <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read1">1</a>]</sup> or Geo Hack Week <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read2">2</a>]</sup>. Other events such as collegiate hackathons sponsored by Major League Hacking typically start recruitment about two months before the actual event <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read3">3</a>]</sup>.

                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Recruitment strategy: There are two general strategies for participant recruitment: open and closed. The organizers should decide which strategy to use based on the goals of their hackathon. Open recruitment targets a wide range of participants with the aim to diversify participation. As such, open recruitment is typically used for hackathons whose main goal is to build a community around the cause or theme. The aforementioned hackathons  Astro Hack Week <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read1">1</a>]</sup> and Geo Hack Week <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read2">2</a>]</sup> used open recruitment inviting anyone with an interest in astronomy and data science. Alternatively, the organizers could also use closed recruitment thus only inviting specific participants who e.g. are internal to a specific community. Examples for such hackathons are Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read4">4</a>]</sup> and the STScI hack days <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read5">5</a>]</sup> who only recruited among their employees. Many tech companies hold such events to foster innovation, to promote a more open and innovative culture, and to help create richer and farther-reaching social ties <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read6">6</a>]</sup>. If the event is a community event, organizers need to identify and invite individuals who might be interested in the particular cause or theme that serves as the <i>glue</i> for the community. Hackathons mostly are recurring events that are sometimes held by groups, such as scientific research communities, who have continuous needs to train members, maintain or implement new features, or work on interoperability issues for shared tools. The HackWeek Toolkit provides detailed suggestions for defining a suitable audience and scope an event to the needs of specific communities <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read7">7</a>]</sup>.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">After the target audience is identified, organizers should set up a website which should contain basic information about the event such as dates and venue, contact information to enable interested participants to communicate with the organizers, and a registration form. The process of setting up and publishing a website can be streamlined by e.g. creating a repository on GitHub as in the case of the World of Code (WoC) hackathon <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read8">8</a>]</sup>. It is helpful for the organizers to decide on a particular hosting platform, e.g., GitHub, before the event. The organizers should then publicize the website to potential interested participants. When using a GitHub project URL organizers can also encourage interested participants to communicate with them via GitHub issues. In addition to providing information the organizers should also provide contact information and be accessible for potential participants via email and Slack.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">The organizers should also create a pre-event registration form using e.g. Goolge Forms which should be accessible from the website. Through this registration form organizers can also collect additional information about participants’ skills and background, preference of projects and areas, and goals and expectations if they decide to do so. Forms can also include open text boxes to allow participants to propose project ideas or indicate if they are planning to come as a team.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Promoting and advertising an event is typically done by disseminating the previously discussed website to potentially interested individuals through various channels such as processional networks, mailing lists, student groups, university departments, personal networks, and social media such as twitter and Facebook groups depending on the target audience <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read3">3</a>]</sup>. The organizers could also send direct email invitations to individuals who might be interested in taking part in the hackathon as participants or who might promote the event to potentially interested individuals.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">While <b>open selection</b> of participants is often preferred because that it allows every registrant to take part in the event, some hackathons organizers decide to <b>carefully select participants</b> <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read9">9</a>]</sup>. Reasons for selection might be constraints such as the maximum capacity of a venue, funding, etc. as well as to broaden participation from various communities. As described earlier, the choice of the strategy is very much dependent on the event goals. For example, if the goal of the event is to broaden participation in a specific software development community and most registrants are predominantly from a single institution or background, the organizers might want to consider deploying other strategies to broaden their reach. For hackathons with a learning goal, the organizers should a mix of more and less experienced participants. Likewise, hackathons that aim to foster entrepreneurship might want to attract participants from diverse backgrounds and expertise. One approach that seems promising is organizing a mini-hackathon with participants from the community that they wish to attract prior to the main event. This approach has been successfully deployed by the <i>She Innovates</i> <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read10">10</a>]</sup> hackathon. This is an all-women hackathon which aims to get women participants familiarized with the hacking process before they move on to events with more diverse participants.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Moreover, participant recruitment and selection should start as early as possible, at best right after the event theme and goals are formulated. This gives organizers more time to adjust their recruitment strategy when needed, increasing the chance to attract a sufficient number of participants that fit their desired profile. For large events, using an online tool can be helpful for the selection process. Entrofy <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal5read11">11</a>]</sup> is an example for such a tool that allows organizers to extract a subset of registered participants based on certain attributes e.g. gender, career stage, etc., and given value (i.e. the percentage of distribution for each attribute).</p>

                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Open vs selective recruitment:</b> An open recruitment strategy is advisable for hackathons that aim to facilitate networking among participants or hope that they would find new collaborators for future work. However, if the goal of the hackathon is to have a more concrete outcome e.g. creating a working prototype, or learning a specific tool, selective recruitment may help bring in participants most able to contribute or most able to benefit. Selective recruitment helps organizers to diversify participation or select a desired mix of skills and abilities that best serve the purpose of the hackathon. This in turn helps create teams that have the skills and expertise to achieve their project goals. For hackathons with selective recruitment, it is important to make the selection process as transparent as possible e.g. by letting potential participants know how the selection process works, how participants are selected if there are more eligible participants for each category, or which attributes are given greater weight than others, etc. This helps ensure that even if they are not selected, participants might feel the fairness of the selection process and might not feel discouraged to participate in similar events in the future.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Open vs closed hackathon:</b> In a closed hackathon, only members of  a particular organization are eligible to participate. This allows the organizers and participants to freely discuss and work on non-public topics such as new products, competitive strategy, and proprietary technologies. It also makes it easier for teams to coordinate their work, since members of the same organization generally share a culture, technical language, and role expectations. On the other hand, open participation allows a much broader mixture of people from different backgrounds, domains, and areas of expertise, which facilitates innovation, learning and community building.</li>

It is thus crucial for organizers to think about how to support participants to come up with interesting and attainable project ideas they can work on during a hackathon. There is also evidence that some ideation approaches, such as traditional brainstorming, can help self-identified minorities feel more welcome and their ideas more accepted during the event <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

Hackathon themes are often intentionally broad covering areas such as civic technologies <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read2">2</a>]</sup>, environmental sustainability <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read3">3</a>]</sup>, entrepreneurship <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read4">4</a>]</sup> and others to allow for a large variety of ideas to fit under their banner. Organizers and stakeholders can also decide to narrow the scope of potential ideas by proposing specific problems (areas) that participants should address. This approach is suitable for targeted events that e.g. aim to develop technologies for a specific community <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read5">5</a>]</sup>. It is important to leave space for participants to develop ideas that are of interest to them, to ensure their motivation to participate.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Ideation can take place <b>before or during a hackathon</b>. For larger audiences it might be advisable to collect ideas prior to an event using technologies such as Google Docs or GitHub issues. It is important to use technologies that projected participants are familiar with. Collecting ideas through such technologies not only allows participants to describe their ideas but also enables others to comment, provide feedback and express interest. They also allow organizers and stakeholders to pre-screen ideas, adjust their ideation approach and capture ideas for future use beyond the context of a particular hackathon.</p>

It also allows organizers to guide ideation by asking targeted questions <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal8read8">8</a>]</sup> and clustering ideas e.g. based on participant interest. Ideation during a hackathon does takes away time for hacking though especially for larger audiences.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Collecting a <b>sufficient number of interesting ideas</b> is crucial for a successful hackathon because ideas usually form the basis for selecting teams. Collecting many <i>interesting</i> ideas is, however, not the only aspect to consider during ideation. Ideas also should be <i>attainable</i>. This means that they need to be doable during the short duration of a hackathon, that the team that attempts them has or can quickly attain the skills required to complete a project based on that idea, and that there are sufficient resources available at the hackathon, including, for example, specialized hardware, licenses, cloud resources, or others. Organizers, stakeholders and mentors can support teams to select suitable ideas and help them scope their project during the hackathon.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, it is important to consider that <b>some ideas might be extremely popular while others do not draw much attention</b>. If some ideas prove extremely popular, the idea can sometimes be split into parts, or several teams can be formed to pursue the same idea. If ideas are not popular at all it should be clear to all participants that they will not be attempted during the hackathon. Participants proposing ideas thus have to be prepared to let go of their idea and potentially join a different team and work on something else.</p>

                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Priming vs open ideation:</b> Leaving ideation completely open and in the hands of the participants can lead to them to coming up with ideas that are not, or only marginally, related to the goal of the hackathon, or with ideas that are not doable due to other constraints imposed by the setup of the event (time, specialized resources, available skills, etc.). If the primary goal is just to have fun or some basic exposure to coding and its possibilities, this may be fine. On the other hand, imposing strict limitations on the ideation process by e.g. limiting participants to address specific challenges proposed by organizers or stakeholders can in turn negatively affect the motivation of participants to attend an event and take on the proposed challenges. To address this tradeoff, it is thus advisable to always leave room for participants to develop their own ideas even when proposing challenges.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Individual ideation vs group ideation:</b> This tradeoff is common for most creativity techniques. Asking participants to develop ideas individually and share them after ideation has ended typically leads to more diverse ideas since people tend to follow the direction of ideas that have already been proposed. Some participants might however also benefit from others sharing their ideas because it can foster their imagination. One way of dealing with this tradeoff is to take a two-step approach by asking participants to submit individual ideas prior to the hackathon and then sharing them at the beginning of the event allowing other ideas to be added. Moreover, posing multiple (potentially contradicting) ideation themes might also help participants to come up with diverse ideas.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Time for ideation vs time to hack:</b> Conducting the ideation at the beginning of or during a hackathon provides organizers with an opportunity to steer its direction, emphasize ideas that they perceive to be best related to their goals and allows participants to develop additional related ideas. It does however also cut into the time that remains for hacking. This tradeoff becomes more problematic for larger hackathons because each participant should have the chance to propose ideas to keep the morale up which might not be possible at larger events. For larger events it is advisable to move ideation online or to ask participants to send ideas before the event.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Too large vs too small:</b> Ideas should be interesting and challenging but at the same time doable during the short duration of a hackathon. One approach to deal with this trade-off would be to let participants propose wild ideas first that can then be scaled down to doable projects through mentoring. In order to avoid mismatched expectations, it is important for participants to be gently encouraged to be realistic in what they can hope to accomplish during an event. Prototypes where only a few example features are implemented simply, and difficult technical challenges such as analyzing substantial data sets or developing APIs are simply faked. Such compromises are common and often necessary.</li>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Another important decision for organizers is selecting an appropriate strategy for selecting projects and forming teams. Teams are typically formed from the recruited participant pool, around projects of interest to them.</p>

Team formation and project selection can take place either <b>before the event</b> or <b>at the beginning of the event</b>. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, as we will discuss in the trade-offs below. Even if the intent is to choose teams and projects at the beginning of the event, organizers should expect that some participants may join the hackathon as a team, with firm ideas about what they want to work on, and with whom.</p>

                                            <p>There are three roles involved in the team formation and project selection process. These roles are project <b>proposers</b>, <b>moderators</b>, and <b>joiners</b>. The proposer refers to someone who pitches a project idea at the event. This role can be taken by participants, organizers or stakeholders. The joiners are participants who selected the project they are interested in, sometimes also selecting a role that they would like to play at the event. For example, during Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read1">1</a>]</sup>, project proposers specified roles required for their proposed projects and other participants joined the project teams by taking one of these roles (cf. Microsoft HackBox <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read2">2</a>]</sup>). The organizer or a dedicated person takes the role of moderator who facilitates the team formation process in order to configure project teams with skills, expertise, background, and reasonable size required to complete the projects they aim to work on. For hackathons at scale, it is important to assist the moderator with a tool that facilitates the matching of participants and projects.</p>

Organizers try to attract suitable participants as part of participant selection and recruitment process which has to be finished before team formation.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Teams can be formed either by <b>open selection</b>, <b>assignment</b>, or a <b>hybrid</b> strategy. In open selection, participants select projects and roles that they want to play based on their interest from the list of all available projects and roles. In the assignment strategy, a mediator assigns projects and roles to participants. The hybrid strategy narrows down the participant’s search space by filtering out projects and roles that seem to be of lesser interest to participants or that they might be less qualified for. For assignment and hybrid strategy, it is important to gather participants’ needs and expectations beforehand to optimize team formation. Information like that is typically collected through the registration process as part of participant recruitment.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Forming teams <b>before a hackathon</b> requires suitable online tools such as Google Docs, Google Forms or GitHub issues. Suitable tools need to support project listing and sign up. For example, in the STScI hack days <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read3">3</a>]</sup> we observed that Google Forms were used to collect project preferences and skills. Based on this information, the organizers configured  teams of 3 to 6 participants with a good mix of skills. Some hackathons, e.g. Steelhacks <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read4">4</a>]</sup>, suggest participants to form teams of 5. These tools work well for smaller events (say, 50 or fewer participants) but a more sophisticated tool would be required for larger scale such as Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon. They deployed the online tool HackBox <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read2">2</a>]</sup> that allowed participants to create projects proposal, sign up for projects and search for additional members with specific skills or interests.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">It is common for teams to form <b>at the beginning of a hackathon</b>. This process needs to be fairly efficient so that teams will have sufficient time to actually work on their project. One common approach is to allow participants that have a project idea to pitch it in front of the other participants, and write each idea down on a flip chart or whiteboard. The remaining participants are then given some time to walk around and chat with the project proposers and select a project they would like to work on. It is common to aim for teams of similar size between 3 and 6 members. It is particularly important for competitive hackathons to have teams of similar size since a large difference between team sizes could lead to an unfair disadvantage for some teams.  Moreover, large teams should be avoided because they typically require additional coordination effort which can limit the time a team has to actually work on their project. They thus need to potentially be split up, and ideas that do not draw much interest are generally abandoned. In another small-scale hackathon we observed, organizers asked the participants to rank proposed projects in order of their preference in Google Docs and participants were assigned to the project on a first-come-first-serve basis. This process might not be feasible for events at scale and using a tool like HackBox would be necessary even if team formation occurred at the hackathon.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">For hackathons where teams are formed on site, it is sometimes desirable for organizers to propose projects, and either post descriptions in advance, develop brief pitches and make them available to participants as videos, or describe them at the beginning of an event. This approach is particularly useful when the goal of a hackathon is, for example, to introduce newcomers to a particular domain, tool set, or scientific community. In these cases, it is very difficult for the projected participants to develop with feasible and appropriate project ideas themselves.</p>

It is important to note here that these trade-offs are not independent, and organizers should consider balancing them when making decisions about team formation and project selection.</p>
                                            <ol class="list space2x">
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Forming teams before vs at a hackathon:</b> Pitching projects and even forming teams before an event can help to get the project work under way more quickly at the hackathon itself. However, there are some costs to this approach. Projects proposed before an event, even if there is an opportunity to pitch at the event itself, are likely to be chosen since participants have become familiar with them. They will not have the benefit of being discussed face to face with the potential for cross-fertilization and innovation this can provide. Moreover, if teams are chosen before an event, there is generally very little interaction, during the hackathon, among participants on different teams. If growing a community and forming broader social networks are important goals, it is generally advisable to pitch and discuss ideas at the hackathon itself.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Proposing projects by participants vs by organizers:</b> Most hackathons allow participants to define their own project ideas, and this is often a primary motivation for participants, to do something fun and acquire skills they want. For some hackathons, however, participants are simply not in a good position to formulate projects that are feasible and appropriate for the theme of an event. They may lack technical skills, domain knowledge, or both. In these cases, it is desirable for organizers to define projects that will help the participants. This approach combines well with pre-event tutorials and dedicated mentors <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read5">5</a>]</sup> because teams will likely need a lot of help to make progress. Since they are not pursuing their own passion, motivation for participation needs to be carefully considered though which may consist of things like valuable contacts for their future profession, potential job offers, or developing skills that are in demand. Recruiting materials should lay these benefits out convincingly.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Open selection vs assignment:</b> Open selection of teams is common for hackathons organized around themes (e.g. particular civic issues, making use of specific data sets, etc.) and for hackathons designed just for fun or, for exposure to programming or prototype development or entrepreneurship. Open selection is beneficial in the sense that it allows participants to choose what they want to work on in contrast to the strict assignment approach that does not consider participants' motivations, needs and expectations. However, there are some costs associated with open selection. For example, teams may not have members with skills required to complete a desired project. A lack of diversity may also inhibit a team’s ability to create innovative ideas and solutions. For this type of hackathons, it is often helpful to have webinars and pointers to resources prior to the actual event. This put participants in a much better position to formulate realistic and on-target project ideas quickly. Another way to alleviate this trade-off is having a balanced - hybrid - approach which could provide participants with choices which are closely related to their goals and expectations.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Large vs small teams:</b> Organizers should expect that even if they try to have teams with reasonable size, teams may be larger than the desirable size of 3 to 6 participants. Larger teams are more likely to encounter coordination problems compared to smaller teams. This problem might even be more significant in teams consisting of members who have not collaborated before because they do not have a common knowledge about each other’s skills and working practices <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal9read1">1</a>]</sup>, which could lead to them not being able to generate the outcomes they want. Hackathons with open selection are more likely to suffer this problem as no moderation is applied to the team formation. To minimize this issue, the organizers should try to ensure teams have reasonable size regardless of the team formation strategy they use.</li>

                                            <p>It is important to develop a mentoring strategy and recruit suitable mentors prior to a hackathon. Since they are likely to be busy people, and mentoring generally takes a substantial chunk of their time, recruiting weeks or months in advance is desirable. Mentoring itself typically takes place either over the entire duration of a hackathon or at specific points during the event. It can also continue after a hackathon has ended.</p>

                                            <p>Mentoring requires the collaboration of organizers, mentors and participants. Organizers create a mentoring strategy, recruit mentors and support them to execute the developed strategy during and after a hackathon. Mentors support participating teams based on this strategy. The time commitment asked of the mentors should be made very clear. For example, are they expected to help participants before and/or after the event itself? Are they expected to stay for the entire event, work in shifts, or just be available at checkpoints?</p>

                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Prior to a hackathon, organizers have to develop a mentoring strategy and recruit suitable individuals as mentors.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline"><b>Mentoring strategy:</b> The most common strategy is for mentors to provide individual <b>on-demand support</b> during a hackathon based on the mentor’s expertise. This is appropriate when the participants are generating their own projects, and have the basic skills required to complete them. On-demand mentors typically circulate among teams and/or staff a <i>help desk</i> location where participants can receive assistance when needed. In addition, organizers often set specific checkpoints during which mentors engage with teams, ask for their current progress and provide targeted feedback. Alternatively, the event may have <b>dedicated mentors</b> that are assigned to an individual team <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal11read1">1</a>]</sup>. This is useful when the participants have significant skill deficiencies, or don’t have sufficient domain knowledge to define projects that fit within the hackathon theme (e.g., scientific hackathons aimed at bringing neophytes into a field). For either strategy, it is crucial that mentors are accessible to teams when they need them. </p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">If possible, <b>in-person mentoring</b> is highly desirable, although it is possible to mentor, through technical means like Slack, Zoom, Google Meet or other conferencing and messaging platforms. <b>Online mentoring</b> can be more difficult than anticipated because of the limitations of tools, hardware, and the difficulty of mentors being fully aware of the team context. If using a platform like Slack, for example, it can be difficult, time-consuming, and frustrating to describe problems and solutions in text. For conferencing tools like Zoom, it may be difficult for all team members to see a mentor or share the mentor’s screen on the small screen of a laptop. Moreover, a remote mentor will not have the ability to easily see the confusion, skill deficiencies, or frustration that teams may be experiencing. We thus strongly encourage in-person mentoring whenever possible.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">In addition, organizers might want to create mandatory <b>checkpoints</b> during which teams present their progress to mentors and to the other participating teams. Such checkpoints allow for mentors and teams to detect deficiencies that might have remained unnoticed and provide an opportunity for broad feedback to all teams at once.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Another aspect to consider is whether to have <b>individual mentors</b> supporting participants or to form <b>mentor teams</b> with diverse backgrounds and expertise. Individual mentors allow for a more flexible deployment while mentor teams can provide holistic feedback to participating teams on a broad range of issues. Mentor teams also provide opportunities for less experienced mentors to learn from their more experienced peers. In the case that organizers decided for mentoring teams, it is important to define them prior to or at the beginning of the event.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Organizers also have to decide <b>how many mentors</b> to recruit for their hackathon, and how many of them to deploy at specific points during the hackathon. This decision depends on the number of participating teams, the availability of mentors and other recruitment related aspects we will discuss in the following. It also depends on the time of a hackathon since mentor support is mostly needed during the early and late phases of an event. As a rule of thumb using a minimal mentor to participant ratio of 1 to 10 is feasible since teams commonly have fewer than 10 participants.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline"><b>Recruitment:</b> Depending on the strategy, the organizers have to decide how to recruit suitable mentors. Common aspects for recruitment are the expertise of individuals related to the theme or domain of the event, their technical proficiency related to the technologies that participants might use during a hackathon, their prior hackathon (mentoring) experience and their ability to guide teams and support them to perform to the best of their abilities. A <i>good</i> mentor <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal11read2">2</a>,<a href="#decisionsModal11read3">3</a>]</sup> thus possesses a combination of domain, technical, project management and social skills. To recruit suitable individuals, organizers also have to think about potential benefits for mentors since they will invest a lot of time and effort into mentoring. For example, mentors can sometimes be drawn from tech companies who are hoping to find new recruits among the participants, or from faculty or postdocs looking for talented students.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">After recruiting suitable individuals, organizers need to provide them with suggestions on how to mentor [<sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal11read4">4</a>]</sup> teams based on the previously decided mentoring strategy. This includes potential activities before a hackathon such as training webinars as well as their availability during the event either on site or online. It is crucial that mentors are available to teams when they need them because the tight time constraints of a hackathon do not allow teams to get stuck for long. Mentors will be particularly busy during the early and late phases of a hackathon. During the early phases, teams commonly need help scoping their project and technical support to get started. During the late phases, everyone is scrambling to fix last minute issues which can also lead to increased mentor demand.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Mentors need to be introduced to the participants either before or at the beginning of a hackathon. This introduction should include how and when participants can engage with mentors and which mentor can help them with specific topics or issues. It is important to remind mentors that a hackathon is not for them to push their own ideas. It is about helping teams to run their project their way.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">In some cases, mentoring can also continue after a hackathon has ended to e.g. facilitate the continuity of learning or complete the development and integration of a technical artifact. This depends however on the mutual interest of participants, mentors and organizers and should be discussed at best before the end of a hackathon.</p>

                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Dedicated mentors vs on-demand mentors:</b> On-demand mentors - if sufficient in number and covering all the necessary skills - can quickly address the needs of any team while dedicated mentors can build a relationship with a team and be more effective and efficient supporting them and helping them define a project and acquire skills they need. Supplying a larger hackathon with individual team mentors can however prove to be challenging. Moreover, dedicated mentors might be inclined to take over certain aspects of a project which might negatively affect a teams’ motivation and give them an unfair advantage especially during a competitive hackathon.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Mentor teams vs individual mentors:</b> One benefit of mentoring teams is that participants can get comprehensive support related to multiple aspects of their project (domain, technical advice, scoping, etc.). They are thus particularly useful when using checkpoints because these allow for mentors to take time to address multiple potential issues the team is facing at the same time. Mentor teams also allow less experienced mentors to gain more experience while working with more experienced peers. These benefits however only materializes when the mentors in a team have different expertise and experiences and forming teams requires additional coordination effort by the organizers. Individual mentors on the other hand can flexibly offer targeted advice for teams in need. This does however require teams to know who they should address for specific topics. Individual mentoring also makes better use of each individual mentor’s time but limit support to the expertise of one mentor at a time only.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Mentor background:</b> Each mentor should at best be an experienced project manager and domain expert with years of technical experience in the field, lots of hackathons under her/his belt and the ability to solve any problem a team might have. Since this is not always possible, it is important that organizers carefully select mentors with complementing backgrounds and skills. Moreover, participants and mentors need to be aware of the skills of other mentors, to be able to refer participants to suitable mentors if needed. This can be achieved by individually introducing mentors at the beginning of a hackathon, creating short online profile and/or by e.g. creating colored badges that indicate which kind of support each individual mentor can provide. Moreover, mentoring teams can mitigate this issue if they are formed as discussed before.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Participant to mentor ratio:</b> At first glance it appears that more mentors are always better since more mentors can support more teams. This is however not true in all circumstances since e.g. having many mentors that can help with domain related questions and none that can help with technical problems is not desirable. Moreover, more mentors create more organizational overhead for organizers and might result in conflicting messages to participants since different mentors might provide different advice to teams based on their personal experience and background. Starting with a mentor to participant ratio of 1 to 10 can serve as a rule of thumb. It is however important for organizers still ask themselves is which expertise might be required by participating teams at different points during a hackathon. At the beginning of an event, participants will mostly require help related to scoping their project while later the required support will shift stronger towards domain and technology related questions. Inexperienced teams may also need help setting up their technical environment and tools. When deciding for mentors it is thus important to consider which expertise needs to be available to participants at which point during an event. Moreover, mentoring can also be streamlined by using the previously discussed checkpoints.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Strict guidance vs mentors decide how to engage:</b> While there are general mentoring <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal11read2">2</a>]</sup> and hackathon mentoring <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal11read3">3</a>,<a href="#decisionsModal11read4">4</a>]</sup> guidelines available online, it is important to note that each hackathon is slightly different with different goals, organizers, participants and mentoring requirements. Given this highly context-dependent nature of hackathons, it is might be helpful under certain circumstances to advise mentors about how and when and how to engage with their teams. Under other circumstances organizers might also just let mentors engage with teams at any point in any way they want. Both extremes are not feasible. Providing strict guidance would limit the ability – in particular of experienced mentors – to provide useful support. Providing no guidance might affect the overall structure of a hackathon. A hackathon is an intensive event during which a lot of things happen over a short period of time and mentors are crucial for an event to be successful. Spreading information about who is responsible for and knowledgeable about which topic and setting fixed checkpoints to reel everyone back in can thus help to mitigate this tradeoff. In general, however, the more competitive the event the more it is necessary, in the name of fairness, to provide relatively strict guidance  and limits on what sort of assistance mentors should provide.</li>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Organizers might want to run a hackathon just for everyone to have a good time. They might however also want to organize one for a purpose that extends beyond the conclusion of the hackathon, for example to kickstart a community, teach participants about new technologies or create innovative products and services that will actually be brought to market. Continuity does not come for free though. It needs to be an integral part of the hackathon planning process.</p>

                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Before planning for continuity, organizers and potential stakeholders need to think about what the outcome of a hackathon should be and how the continuation of this outcome can be supported. When thinking about hackathon outcomes most people will think of hackathon projects that get turned into startups <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal12read1">1</a>]</sup>. The transformation of projects into startups is however not the only potential outcome worthy of being continued. Participants and/or organizers might also aim to extend existing products or services, foster community growth or spread knowledge about certain domains and technologies. Each of these outcomes might require a different continuation strategy.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">Based on the decision of which outcome should be continued, hackathon organizers can then focus on involving potential stakeholders. Such stakeholders can e.g. be companies if the continuation goal is to develop a product or service, or communities with related or complementary interests if the goal is to start or grow a community. Stakeholders are vital for continuity planning since they can provide background and domain knowledge for hackathon projects, support participants to scope their projects, connect participants to key players after a hackathon has ended, and provide access to learning materials. It is also important for organizers to set suitable expectations for stakeholders and participants since there is only so much that can be achieved during the short timeframe of a hackathon. This makes it all the more important to plan for what can be done before, during and after an event to support continuation if that is the organizers’ goal. Examples for how organizers can support continuation is to suggest for participants to scope their project before and start learning about technologies they might want to use <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal12read3">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
                                            <p class="modal-content-inline">During a hackathon organizers and stakeholders should provide an environment for participants that fosters the desired outcome. If an important goal is for participants to have the opportunity to establish lasting social bonds, the organizers should put an emphasis on activities that allow for them to not only work on their projects in their teams but also to get in contact with other participants. This could happen in the form of games or other social activities. For participants to develop a project that can be continued afterwards, they should encourage participants to work on a strategy on how to spread the word about their project after the hackathon or to ensure that what they develop can be easily integrated into an existing code base. If the goal is to sustain participants’ learning, e.g. about technologies they used during the hackathon, it might be useful to propose follow-up projects or connect them to other individuals that aim to learn about the same technology.</p>
                                            <p>Participants and organizers might have different continuation goals after an event <sup>[<a href="#decisionsModal12read4">4</a>]</sup>. Most participants might not even be interested to continue working on their project after a hackathon. Since continuation requires extra work from participants, it is important to identify and provide support to those who are interested in continuation. One approach to achieve this is simply to ask participants if they are interested in continuation, and based on their response provide support and guidance. This support can – depending on the planned outcome – come in the form of startup funding, connecting participants to relevant parties that can support them, help them find resources, or simply contacting them from time to time after the hackathon to see what happened and provide targeted support if needed.</p>

From the descriptions it should be clear that some outcomes might require approaches and strategies that can negatively affect other outcomes. For example, organizing social gatherings during a hackathon might foster participant networking thus potentially contributing to connection continuity. Such gatherings however eat into the participants’ time to work which can negatively affect their project outcome thus potentially jeopardizing its continuation after the hackathon.</p>
                                            <ol class="list space2x">
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Project continuity:</b> The development of useful artifacts that continue to be developed or that get used after a hackathon is among the most common continuity goals. This requires – as discussed before – a strong focus on the project as such. It is advisable for teams to meet and refine their project idea before the event, validate it with potential stakeholders and then use the hackathon to develop it to a stage that it can be shown to stakeholders. This means that the hackathon essentially serves the purpose of the team focusing on the development of a presentable prototype for their project. It also means that team members choose which aspect of a project they work on predominantly based on their current skills and not on what they want to learn about.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Connection continuity:</b> To support connection continuity it is important to ensure that participants can stay in touch after a hackathon. Technical means such as a shared Slack channel, a shared Google Drive folder or similar tools can be already used leading up to and during a hackathon. These tools enable participants to quickly get on board and start communicating and sharing information about themselves and their projects while the event is still going on. Organizers should also consider creating opportunities for participants to engage with other like-minded participants outside their project teams during and after the hackathon to foster continuous engagement after the hackathon has ended. None of these will work, however, unless the participants are substantially motivated to stay in touch, perhaps to act as sounding board or social support, to network opportunities such as jobs, or to provide each other with  needed expertise in various domains. It might also be worthwhile to introduce teams to each other that worked on similar projects which serve as a proxy for the connection continuity.</li>
                                                <li class="list-item"><b>Learning continuity:</b> To foster learning continuity it is not only important to provide means of access to learning material before, during and after an event but also to create continuing interests, e.g. through challenges during and after a hackathon. Moreover, it is important to ensure that participants choose project aspects based on what they want to learn rather than what they already know.</li>
